# HopeAccess

An NGO & Charity Staff Portal for managing staff, programs, beneficiaries, and donors — with role-based access control so every team member sees only what they need to.

---

## Features

- **Authentication** — JWT-based login with secure bcrypt password hashing
- **User Management** — Create, update, and deactivate staff accounts with granular permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Admins have full access; staff see only their assigned programs
- **Programs** — Create and manage NGO initiatives, assign staff members, track status
- **Beneficiaries** — Record and manage beneficiaries per program; staff can only access their own programs
- **Donors** — Admin-only donor records with full donation history and multi-currency support
- **Dashboard Stats** — Live impact numbers: staff count, active programs, beneficiaries served, donations received

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose installed

### Run with Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahman04/Sentinel.git
cd Sentinel
docker-compose up --build
```

Three services start automatically:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000 |
| API Docs (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |

### Default Admin Account

On first run, a default admin account is created automatically:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `admin@sentinel.io` |
| Password | `admin123` |

## Testing

### Run Backend Tests

```bash
docker-compose exec backend pytest
```

### What was tested

**Automated tests (pytest + httpx):**
- Login with valid credentials returns a JWT token
- Login with wrong password returns 401
- Unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints return 401
- Non-admin users cannot access admin-only endpoints (403)
- Default admin account is seeded on first run

**Manual testing:**
- All CRUD flows tested for Users, Programs, Beneficiaries, and Donors
- Role-based access verified — staff cannot see Users, Donors, or programs they are not assigned to
- Admin and staff dashboard stats verified to show correct scoped data
- API endpoints tested directly via Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
